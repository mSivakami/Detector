# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Uselessly Useful


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sivakami Matheth - Government Engineering College, Thrissur

### Project Description
This project recognizes human emotions and makes humorous comments as response. It isn't going to be kind to you, no matter whether you're happy, sad or mad!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

We poke fun at people for feeling things(which is pretty natural) and make fun of them for feeling anything at all.Grass is always greener on the other side, so we tell happy people to smile less,and sad people to quit crying.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A website to analyse their feelings and annoy them about how they're feeling. Serves no purpose to them at all. Might make them feel even more annoyed at being human.
Oh, also while we're at it, we frustruate them with a cheeky enter button before they even start, which is not clickable the first few times and shifts position when the cursor hovers over it.

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

This is the entry page that has the runaway button that finally lets the user click it after messing with them.

This is one of the silly comments shown when it detects a sad face. The start recording and end recording buttons allow the user to record a video of them making faces at the camera, for no reason at all ofcourse.

This is the response of the website on seeing a happy face.
